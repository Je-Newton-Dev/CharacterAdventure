# CharacterAdventure
A simple C# console adventure game. My first coding project. 
## Features
- Create a character with strength, agility, intelligence, and gold.
- Make choices that affect your stats.
- Replay option with branching outcomes.

## What I Learned
- Using variables, lists, and loops in C#
- Creating branching logic with if-statements
- Using while-loops for replayable games
- Setting up GitHub and publishing my first project

## Future Plans
- Add random chance events (duels, cave exploring outcomes)
- Add input validation
- Add leveling system with XP
